# Tourism Trends in European countries

# Abstract
The wealth of European culture, variety of landscapes and the quality of infrastructures makes Europe one of the major tourist destinations. Tourism is one of the most rapidly growing global industries; Thus, tourism forecasting is becoming an increasingly important activity in planning and managing the industry. Our project idea is to investigate the tourism industry in European countries.
Tourism is economically important for the development of a country. Currently there are an estimated 12.7 million people employed by the tourism industry in EU. Our goal is to investigate the nature of tourism and if there are certain factors affecting the popularity of the countries as a touristic place. We will investigate the nights spent by people at hotels and see how many nights people not from the host country spent in these hotels (or generally any accommodations) and from which countries do they come from. We will also see the participation/non-participation of different countries (in the EU) in tourism through time depending on sex, age, education, income and employment. More importantly we will analyse how tourists spent their hard-earned money. All these insights might be useful for people, countries and businesses involved in the tourism sector.

# Research questions
* How has tourism trends shifted throughout the years?
* What variations occur between months of the year in tourism rates, interest in tourism, and its effects on the industry?
* How volatile is the job market in the tourism sector?
* Do people prefer to travel to cheaper places? How does prices in the country affect its attractiveness to travellers?
* How factors such as sex, age, education, income and employment affect the participation of people in tourism?
* How these same characteristics affect the money spent by tourists? Are there specific target countries for each group of people?

# Dataset
We will be using the Eurostat dataset that is open to public. (https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/data/database), mainly focusing on the datasets under "Database by themes > Industry, trade and services > Tourism (tour) > Monthly data on tourism industries" 
The data is in different tables and we will join these tables (on the country names mostly) to get the info we need.
The tables are mostly index by country name and the columns are time (month/year) and different categories (in cases where they apply) like sex, income etc. The fields are mostly number of people and there are some fields that are missing, or which are estimates.
The data is in the .tsv format compressed into a .gz file.
Examples of the data available:
* [Nights spent at tourist accommodation establishments - monthly data] (https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/estat-navtree-portlet-prod/BulkDownloadListing?file=data/tour_occ_nim.tsv.gz)
* [Purchasing power parities (PPPs), price level indices and real expenditures for ESA 2010 aggregates] (https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/estat-navtree-portlet-prod/BulkDownloadListing?file=data/prc_ppp_ind.tsv.gz)


# A list of internal milestones up until project milestone 2
* Downloading and cleaning the data. (estimates and missing values)
* Preliminary visualization and analysis (Exploratory Data Analysis)
* Finding and visualizing possible trends in the data by Answering Our research questions. 
* Explore datasets in other areas that could provide additional insights on the trends observed in tourism datasets
* Explore data visualization methods for data related to geographical locations
* Design report/blog layout

# Questions for TAs
* What tools are available for creating appealing and informative visualizations of information by country?
* What are the requirements on the complexity of our analysis? Is it more important to conduct difficult analysis or present valuable results?
