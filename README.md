# Tourism Trends in European countries
# Milestone 3
The focus of the project has shifted towards the seasonality of tourism (changes between the months of the year). Specfically, we will focus on answering these questions:
* What seasonal changes exist in tourism
* What are the general trends throughout the years. Have they changed?
* How predictable are the seasonal trends. What techniques can be used to predict them?
* What factors contribute to a countries popularity in tourism

That last question requires a large number of data sources. We mostly used EuroStat datasets, but also the World Banks' climate API to obtain temperature and precipitation data

## Team roles:
Kiarash:
* Viz relating to seasonality and trends and sesonal decomposition
* SARIMA Model cross validation and forecasting
* Map visualisation
* sociodemographic data exploration

Zhiqing:
* Exploration of map plots
* Report abstract and introduction
* General data exploration

Chengzhong:
* Factors contributing to tourism
  * Exploration of regression techinques
  * Feature selection and feature weight analysis (permuatation importance and recursive)
  * Analysis of features
  * Regression model evaluation
  * Finding datasets that may potentially contribute to tourism
  * Collection, joining, parsing, filtering, and cleaning of multiple data sources
* Early ARIMA exploration, and autocorrelation plots
* Early seasonal trends exploration and plotting
* Will focus on displaying their section during presentation
